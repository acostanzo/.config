# Config
This repo contains the shareable portions of my mac configs. I uses this to maintain a similar development environment on multiple machines. You can use it if you see something you like when we pair.

## Prerequisite
If you want the whole configuration, set you will need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
## Setup
1. Clone this repo to `~/.config` (be sure to backup anything in your `~/.config` folder before taking these configurations)
1. Run the setup script: `~/.config/bin/setup`
